# CSGO_Internal
A partially outdated CS:GO training base / internal for personal use.

## Compile modes
- Dev -> Used for internal testing, but shouldn't be used for official use.
- Debug -> The mode you want to use for debugging crashes, etc.
- Release -> The mode you want to compile in for official use.

## How to build
1. Open CSGO_Internal.sln
2. Select the build type at the top. (Debug, Dev, Release)
3. Select "Build" and "Build Solution", or, CTRL + SHIFT + B
4. A "Build" directory will be created. The module is in that directory.

## How to use
- Use any injector to load the DLL. It supports ManualMap or LoadLibrary.

## Features
- Basic, safe to use VMT hooking library. (EasyVMT)
- Example bunnyhop.
- Example fog removal by hook.
- Various CSGO virtual function hooks.
- Stable, easy to use configuration system.

## Side note
I was going to update the code and have everything nice and clean, but I don't have much time to do so, and stopped playing CS:GO. Some stuff is unoptimized, but is stable. If you'd like to clean it up, feel free.
