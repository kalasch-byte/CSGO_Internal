# CSGO_Internal
A partially outdated CS:GO training base / internal for personal use.

# There is 3 compile modes
- Dev -> Used for internal testing, but shouldn't be used for official use.
- Debug -> The mode you want to use for debugging crashes, etc.
- Release -> The mode you want to compile in for official use.
